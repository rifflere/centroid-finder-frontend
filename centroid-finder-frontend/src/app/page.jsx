      <h4>
        This program is designed to help salamander researchers from Ohio State University track and record data of salamanders. 
        Using computer vision, the system processes video footage to identify and follow the movement of individual salamanders in a controlled environment. 
        It calculates their centroids and logs positional data into CSV files for further analysis. 
        The goal is to automate and streamline data collection, enabling researchers to study movement patterns, behavior, and environmental responses more efficiently.
